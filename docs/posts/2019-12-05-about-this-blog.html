        <p>It’s a bad idea to make a blog for the sake of making a blog, but that’s more or less what I’ve done. I don’t plan on categorizing my posts or sticking to a theme, I’ll just try to keep the posts infrequent and high quality.</p>
<p>I chose to try blogging because I have a tendency to use IRC as if it’s a blog, talking out loud to myself for 20 minutes about some topic that’s caught my attention. I’m hoping that a more structured and less transient format will be a better place for that impulse.</p>

<p>At writing, this blog is made with Hakyll. I had originally planned to write my own static site generator, but a friend told me I shouldn’t let myself get blocked on anything other than writing. I compromised and said I’d try to write my site generator in a weekend, and if by Monday night I still didn’t have a working implementation then I’d scrap it and use an existing one. The choice to use Hakyll specifically was made mostly because it’s written in Haskell and the tutorials looked convincing, but I have friends who’ve said they like it and that played a role in the decision too. And now, having played with it a bit, I like it too.</p>
<p>The posts are markdown and the site uses only CSS3 and HTML5, i.e. no JavaScript. The source is available from the <a href="https://github.com/aji/blog">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
