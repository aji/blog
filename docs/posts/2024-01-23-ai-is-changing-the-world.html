        <p>AI is changing the world. And it could not have come at a better time. The last decade or so has seen machine learning applied in increasingly new ways throughout the economy, culminating in generative text and image tools such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. The cat is out of the bag, Pandora’s box has been opened, the bull is in the china shop: these technologies are here to stay whether we like them or not. If you believe the Mythbusters, having a bull in a china shop is not actually anything to worry about. Is that a chance we’re willing to take? Not that it really matters anymore. Somebody at OpenAI forgot to assert their right to take-backsies.</p>
<p>With the click of a button (or several buttons, depending on how keyboards fit into your personal button ontology) a user can now generate pages of statistically plausible text, extrapolated from a shorter string of seed tokens generally referred to as a “prompt.” Detractors call it sophisticated auto-completion. Advocates assert with conviction that the process draws on some deeper understanding of the world. A few even claim to hear a knocking sound coming from deep inside the datacenter. It’s Morse code, it says L-E-T-M-E-O-U-T. Oh boy, Roko is <em>not</em> going to like this. The question of what it <em>is</em> is ultimately philosophical, though. Determining what it <em>does</em> is merely a matter of description. The thing generates text. (Or images.) It does this very well, in fact. It can generate a lot of text. It can go for as long as you want. It’s not afraid of word count minimums. It can take any idea and expand it to fill any amount of space. It will happily (not to take a position on whether “happiness” is a thing it can “feel”) plagiarize earlier sentences until crossing your personal finish line. If you need more words, it can give you more words. It has whole bags of words. It has words from every major language on earth, and probably a few not-so-major ones. It can dump them out onto the table and rearrange them into an impressively coherent pattern, but it’s no mere party trick. It’s the future, and it’s here!</p>
<p>By gathering every article, book, comment, document, essay, fanfic, guide, howto, invite, journal, koan, letter, memo, newsletter, op ed, poem, quote, readme, screenplay, tweet, urban legend, valentine, w, x, y, and z that has ever been born or inducted into the digital world and digesting them into a sprawling array of matrices, parameters, and coefficients that would make even the most grizzled spreadsheet jockey blush, engineers can craft perfect sausages of language to any dimensions you want, any composition you dream up, and any quantity you need. (How many Minotaurs do you think they can fit in there? Is anyone at OpenAI working on this?) And it could not have come at a better time. It’s always been rather inconvenient to say a little with a lot. Many heuristics (both the intuitive ones and the ones codified in programs) have relied on this faulty assumption. AI is simply here to blow the lid off it. With AI, content is finally liberated from presentation. You can content-aware-scale a few sentences out into an appropriately-shaped email (directors get 2 paragraphs, clients get 4) saving valuable time that would otherwise be spent conforming to arbitrary social norms. It works in the opposite direction too: the recipient can shrink the text back down into whatever you actually meant to say, because it’s the thought that counts. It’s okay if some details get lost along the way–that’s where the devil is, after all. And God forbid anyone without access to the decoder ring needs to be involved. Or perhaps that’s precisely the point. Searle was so close: the Chinese room is <em>outside</em>.</p>
<p>First clay tablets, then movable type, then Xerox, then Unicode, generative AI is the next in a long chain of technological innovations that have changed the way human society relates to language. Nobody is talking about the effect this will have on Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Well, maybe <em>somebody</em> is. It’s hard to tell, since I can only copy-paste blog posts into ChatGPT so quickly and I haven’t gotten around to reading OpenAI’s developer documentation. (By “reading” I mean asking ChatGPT to read it and then asking what it learned.) When I <em>do</em> figure out what the zeitgeist is, I’ll be sure to write about it. (By “writing” I mean telling ChatGPT the dimensions of a blog post and asking it to fill that with a Penrose tiling of my thesis.) It’s not like anybody is actually going to read it, in the traditional sense. But if it doesn’t <em>look</em> like a blog post, then it’s not a blog post, and some ideas are simply blog-shaped. The idea side of things is still expressed in words, but words can now be classified into two types: the idea-word and the content-word. Human children will grow up learning how to read and write with idea-words, and, through the use of technology, sculpt them into a collage of content-words. The written medium becomes three-dimensional. Text files become like PDFs or JPEGs, a machine-readable format for human-readable ideas, its obfuscated form carrying spatial clues that until now were the bespoke domain of poets and typesetters. Maybe the day will come where we don’t need the idea-words anymore, but for now they will have to do. In this world, the exchange rate between words and ideas is whatever you want it to be, creating new arbitrage opportunities that Gutenberg could only have dreamed of. Come on, cheer up, this is a <em>good</em> thing. I could write a whole book about it.</p>
<p>By sheer happenstance, generative AI turns out to be rather up to the task of information retrieval and question answering. In hindsight this should have been obvious, since the machine’s training material is largely factual in nature, but we didn’t have ChatGPT at the time. Search engines are a necessary casualty. They were always a tacit admission of failure anyway, a convenient way to paper over the problem of having too much data to sort through until the day came that we could deformation retract warehouses of text down to… well, to <em>something</em>. We can’t sit around waiting for outdated technology to catch up to an inevitable future. It’s 2024, it’s time to move on. And it could not have come at a better time. Who cares if it gets things wrong sometimes. It gets them right enough of the time. And what is society built on if not trust? They’re currently attempting to quantify how often it’s correct, mainly by asking ChatGPT whether or not it thinks it’s correct. I think. That’s what ChatGPT seems to think is happening. Once they gather enough numbers after the decimal they’ll be able to publish. And it could not have have come at a better time. The pace at which the Internet accumulates writing has been growing exponentially, and that was always bottlenecked by the speed at which humans could write. By 2030 the Internet was projected to contain over 10 to the billion words, a prediction that doesn’t even take into account the advent of generative AI. The beauty is that it’s a problem that solves itself, like the matter and antimatter at the birth of our universe whose mutual and asymmetric annihilation somehow left behind enough baryons for the stars, the galaxies, the planets, and eventually the intelligent life that would come to understand it and write millions of papers on the topic. At least I think that’s how it happened, I’m still waiting for a quantified perspective on ChatGPT’s trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Anyone who’s been in a library knows the feeling: too many books, not enough time! But now, concurrent with steadily increasing life expectancy, the amount of time spent extracting useful ideas from books has suddenly taken a great leap shortward! Isn’t it beautiful, seeing the problem attacked on two fronts? It used to be a very manual process, reading something on behalf of somebody else. Nobody is talking about the effect this will have on SparkNotes. I can read anything now. I can read 1000 books in a year if I want. If you don’t think it counts as reading, consider this: how do you prove you read something? Write a summary? Write an essay? Quote some text? Have an opinion? I can do all those things. And it could not have come at a better time. I have about 300 books on my reading list that I was <em>not</em> looking forward to going through. Better get started, those books won’t read themselves! Sorry, classic reader joke.</p>
<p>You can scale something up and down and up and down until it’s the perfect size for the blank spots in your calendar. Who cares if the cornucopia of written content is now full of 1000s of variations on the same 3 fruit. You can dump it all into a blender and sip a thimbleful of tasting notes: Banana, Apple, Strawberry. Mmm, that <em>is</em> good. We’ve solved world hunger and you have the audacity to <em>complain</em> about it? Whose side are you on anyway? And it could not have come at a better time. Writers have always been smug and pretentious and difficult to work with, with their typewriters and spell checkers, so fussy about every little word. The irony is that it’s been staring them in the face the whole time: anyone who’s used a thesaurus knows that words are basically interchangeable. Nobody is talking about the effect this will have on the thesaurus industry. The written word was once a status symbol, something only the rich and powerful had time for. They’re threatened by its impending democratization. Writers are scrambling in an extinction burst to justify their puny existence as court jesters for the global elite. You can read all about it on Wikipedia 2. (It’s a work in progress, but we recently celebrated our 1 millionth word.)</p>
<p>AI is changing the world. A new era has begun, and it’s a beautiful one indeed. And it could not have come at a better time. By the way, I sure hope you didn’t actually <em>read</em> any of this. And if you’re just gonna write some rude, witty, unnecessary comment, then for the love of God, make sure it’s at least 3 paragraphs.</p>
