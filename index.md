Welcome to the Internet web log of Alex "aji" Iadicicco. I'm a software
engineer and hobbyist musician but this blog is for whatever topics are on my
mind. More specifically, I'll talk about software engineering, chiptune music,
other internet music, non-internet music, IRC, chat in general, federated and
peer-to-peer technology, probably machine learning at some point, etc.
