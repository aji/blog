title: About this blog
---

It's a bad idea to make a blog for the sake of making a blog, but that's more
or less what I've done. I don't plan on categorizing my posts or sticking to a
theme, I'll just try to keep the posts infrequent and high quality.

I chose to try blogging because I have a tendency to use IRC as if it's a blog,
talking out loud to myself for 20 minutes about some topic that's caught my
attention. I'm hoping that a more structured and less transient format will be
a better place for that impulse.

At writing, this blog is made with Hakyll. I had originally planned to write my
own static site generator, but a friend told me I shouldn't let myself get
blocked on anything other than writing. I compromised and said I'd try to write
my site generator in a weekend, and if by Monday night I still didn't have a
working implementation then I'd scrap it and use an existing one. The choice to
use Hakyll specifically was made mostly because it's written in Haskell and the
tutorials looked convincing, but I have friends who've said they like it and
that played a role in the decision too. And now, having played with it a bit, I
like it too.

The posts are markdown and the site uses only CSS3 and HTML5, i.e. no
JavaScript. The source is available from the [GitHub repository][github].
